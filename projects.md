# Matildle

A Worldle-inspired game, where you have to guess famous women instead of words. The idea for this game came, when I came across the question: "Which female scientists do you know?", and my answer was: "Marie Curie, ... Marie Curie and hmm... what was her name again? Dorothy Hodgkin..." I considered that a pretty poor performance for a maths student and I thought about a way to improve it. The result is Matildle. Have fun and learn a lot! 

# Imitating Hannibal (without the elephants) - Crossing the alps by bike
16/11/2023

I believe this project to be one of my craziest ones; during the summer of 2021, me and my boyfriend took two bikes, a tent and a phone and cylcled from the tiny Upper Austrian village, where my parents live, to Bergamo in Italy, home of my grandmother, about 700 km south-west. It took us 9 days and quite a few tears and arguments, but in the end, we made it!

# Worldle solver

Inspired by the captivating 3Blue1Brown video [Solving Worldle using information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA) I decided to create my own Worlde solver using information theory and even this might not seem an extraordinarily original idea, it was one of my first "real" coding projects and I was pretty proud of the result!
